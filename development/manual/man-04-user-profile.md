# Single User as Member and Baker Manual

## Introduction

In CakePals, we offer the flexibility for a user to be both a Member and a Baker using a single account. This allows users to switch between roles seamlessly without the need to create separate accounts. In this manual, we'll discuss how this feature works and the benefits it provides.

## How It Works

### Role-Based Authorization

In CakePals, users have two possible roles: "Member" and "Baker". Each role grants specific permissions and access to different features of the application. This role-based authorization allows a user to switch between being a Member and a Baker within the same account.

## Benefits

### **Unified User Experience**

   - Users don't need to remember multiple login credentials or manage separate accounts for different roles. This simplifies the user experience and reduces friction.

   - Users can manage their account details, such as username and password, from a single dashboard. There's no need to update information separately for different roles.

   - If a user decides to transition from being a Member to a Baker (or vice versa), they can do so seamlessly without the need for additional registration.

## Switching Roles

### 1. **Accessing Role Switch**

   - Users can switch their role in their account settings. This option is typically available in the user profile or account management section.

### 2. **Confirmation and Verification**

   - When switching roles, the user may be required to confirm their choice and provide any additional information specific to the new role.

### 3. **Role-Specific Functionality**

   - After switching roles, the user will have access to features and functionality relevant to their selected role.
